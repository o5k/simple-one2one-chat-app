# simple-one2one-chat-app

This project is a simple one to one chat application. It can be used to chat with your mates privately.

I developed it while getting started with NodeJS, Express.js and Socket.io.

## Planned Features
The app currently lacks persistence of messages, that could be saved in a Redis database so that no message can be lost.

## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the simple-one2one-chat-app repository, install the node dependencies and start the app:
### Prerequisites

You need **git** to clone the simple-one2one-chat-app repository.

You need also **npm** and **node** to install the requirements of the project and be able to run the app.

Now browse 2 instances of the app at http://localhost:3000/ to try it:
One in this browser window for example and the other in a private navigation window.

Fill a nickname in each instance. Choose a user to chat with and start your conversation.
